# Solar-Car-MCU
The main control unit for the RAIX Principia Solar Car. Handles driver input from a control panel and CAN forwarding.

This project is a copy from the private Principia Solar Car repository and excludes library and include files for privacy. I contributed alongside two other developers in coding, debugging, and testing this project.

The project uses the PIO and Arduino libraries to control a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
